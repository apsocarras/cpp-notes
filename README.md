# cpp-notes

Landing page for all my C++ related notes (will include related stuff on OS, memory, other hardware points, networking, python interop, etc.)

Submodules will remain private unless I 1. know the book is open source 2. I've completed working my way through notes 3. feel like sharing my notes
